            <h2>Glen Rubén Rodríguez Quintero</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Glen Rubén Rodríguez Quintero, a 13-year-old student
              who loves computer programming, physics, chemistry, and math. I
              like coding in C and C++, which I use for Arduino and ESP32
              projects, Clojure (my favorite), HTML, CSS, and this is my first
              time with JavaScript. I'm currently studying at the IES Miguel
              Servet in Zaragoza, Spain. This simple website is the second in a
              series of science outreach projects I'll be doing in the future,
              and the complexity will increase proportionally to the knowledge I
              acquire as I continue studying such interesting and engaging
              topics. The idea came to me when I noticed the difficulty my
              classmates were having calculating everything related to pulleys
              and levers, so I hope it answers your questions. I hope you enjoy
              it!
            </p>
