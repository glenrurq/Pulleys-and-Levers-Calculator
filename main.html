                Pulleys and levers have been essential tools throughout human
                history, accompanying progress and great achievements since
                ancient times. These simple machines have enabled entire
                civilizations to build impressive monuments, navigators to cross
                seas, and peoples to transform their environment with ingenuity
                and effort.
                <br />
                The famous phrase attributed to Archimedes, "Give me a fulcrum
                and I will move the world," encapsulates the power that the
                lever has had as a symbol of human ingenuity. It was not only a
                physical tool, but also a driving force that helped us
                understand that with the right combination of strength and
                strategy, the impossible can become possible.
                <br />
                Throughout history, pulleys have allowed men and women to lift
                great loads and overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges,
                playing silent protagonists in the construction of architectural
                marvels and in the development of navigation and commerce.
                Without a doubt, pulleys and levers have been fundamental allies
                in transforming our environment and shaping the world we know
                today. His legacy is not only technical, but also a lesson in
                how human creativity can change the course of history with
                simple yet powerful tools.

          <article class="how_it_works" id="section2">
            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>
              A pulley is a wheel with a groove through which a rope or cable
              passes. Pulling on one end of the rope transmits a motion that
              allows you to lift an object attached to the other end. What makes
              a pulley interesting is that, depending on how it's configured, it
              can help us change the direction of the force we apply, reduce the
              amount of force needed, or both at the same time.
              <br />
              There are three main types of pulleys: the fixed pulley, the
              mobile pulley, and the compound pulley (also called a block and
              tackle). Each one has a different mechanical advantage and,
              therefore, a different force formula.
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Fixed Pulley:</strong> It's anchored at one point and
              simply changes the direction of the force. For example, instead of
              having to lift a load by pulling upward, we can pull downward,
              which is more comfortable. However, the force needed is not
              reduced. Its mechanical advantage is 1, so:
              <br />
              <span class="formula">Force = Resistance</span>
              <br />
              <span class="formula">F = R</span>
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Movable Pulley:</strong> This pulley moves with the load.
              It splits the weight between two sections of rope, so only half
              the force is needed to lift the object. Its mechanical advantage
              is 2:
              <br />
              <span class="formula">Force = Resistance / 2</span>
              <br />
              <span class="formula">F = R / 2</span>
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Compound Pulley (Block and Tackle):</strong> This is a
              system that combines multiple pulleys—half fixed and half movable.
              The more movable pulleys you add, the greater the mechanical
              advantage. The general rule is that each movable pulley doubles
              the advantage, so the total mechanical advantage is 2<sup>n</sup>,
              where <em>n</em> is the number of movable pulleys. The formula
              becomes:
              <br />
              <span class="formula">Force = Resistance / 2ⁿ</span>
              <br />
              <span class="formula">F = R / 2ⁿ</span>
              <br />
              For example, if there are 3 movable pulleys, the mechanical
              advantage is 8, and the required force is only one-eighth of the
              load. These systems are commonly used in cranes and hoists to lift
              very heavy objects with minimal effort.
              <br /><br />

              Let's now turn to the lever, another fundamental simple machine. A
              lever is a rigid bar that rotates about a fulcrum. With a lever,
              we can move or lift a load by applying a force in the right place.
              This mechanism was first described by the Greek mathematician
              Archimedes, who said, "Give me a fulcrum, and I will move the
              world." This phrase nicely sums up the power of a well-used lever.
              <br />
              A lever has three main elements: the force, which is the force we
              apply; the resistance, which is the weight or load we want to
              move; and the fulcrum, which is the point around which the bar
              pivots. Depending on the position of these three elements, there
              are three types or degrees of lever: first degree, second degree,
              and third degree.
              <br /><br />

              <strong>First-Degree Lever:</strong> In a first-degree lever, the
              fulcrum is between the force and the resistance. A typical example
              of this type of lever is a seesaw or a pair of scissors. In this
              case, the direction of the force can be changed. For example, by
              applying a downward force, we can lift an object upward. This type
              of lever also allows the required force to be reduced if the power
              arm is longer than the resistance arm. The general formula we use
              for all levers is:
              <br />
              <span class="formula"
                >Power × power arm = Resistance × resistance arm</span
              >
              <br />
              When the arm where we apply the force is longer than the load arm,
              we need less force. In other words, by increasing the distance, we
              reduce the effort. This is the key to levers. In the first-degree
              lever, if the arms are well distributed, a balance or mechanical
              advantage can be achieved that reduces the force required.
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Second-Degree Lever:</strong> The resistance is in the
              middle, between the fulcrum and the power. That is, first comes
              the fulcrum, then the load, and finally the point where we apply
              the force. A classic example is the wheelbarrow. This type of
              lever always reduces the force required, since the power arm is
              longer than the resistance arm. Although it doesn't change the
              direction of movement, it is very useful for transporting heavy
              loads with little effort.
              <br />
              <span class="formula"
                >Power × power arm = Resistance × resistance arm</span
              >
              <br />
              In this type of lever, the longer power arm ensures that the force
              we need to apply is less than the weight of the load. This is why
              a person can lift a heavy load with a wheelbarrow, even if they
              are not very strong.
              <br /><br />

              <strong>Third-Degree Lever:</strong> This is the least intuitive.
              In it, the power is located between the fulcrum and the
              resistance. An example of this is the human arm when we lift an
              object with our hand. The elbow acts as the fulcrum, the muscle
              applies the force (power) in the middle of the arm, and the
              resistance is in the hand. This type of lever does not reduce the
              force required, but rather increases it. However, it has the
              advantage of allowing for faster and more precise movements.
              <br />
              <span class="formula"
                >Power × power arm = Resistance × resistance arm</span
              >
              <br />
              Although in this case the force applied may be greater than the
              weight of the load, we gain speed and precision. This is why it's
              common for tools or body parts where fine control of movement is
              required.
